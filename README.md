<h1>Hi, I'm Azad! Part time student
  
 <h2>About me:</h2>

 Hey there! I’m a tech enthusiast just starting out on my journey into the world of IT and development. I’m driven by a curiosity for how things work and a strong desire to learn the skills that will allow me to create impactful tech solutions. My main focus right now is building a solid foundation in [Aws,Linux.python.terraform,git] but I’m always exploring new areas to expand my toolkit.

Whether it’s a coding project, troubleshooting, or solving tech problems, I love challenges that push me to think and learn. I’m currently seeking an apprenticeship or entry-level role where I can develop my skills in a hands-on environment, contribute to real projects, and grow alongside experienced mentors. If you’re looking for a motivated team player who’s eager to dive into new tasks and bring fresh ideas, let’s connect!
